# The Grid
The Grid is a fork of the Matrix protocol with a different set of core values and a true community management.  
It aims to be care more for privacy and much more friendly to self-hosted infrastructures.

We are currently putting it all together before official kickoff. See the [Sunrise](https://github.com/thegridprotocol/thegrid/projects/1) project for the current progress.
