# The Grid
The Grid is a fork of the Matrix protocol with a different set of core values and a true community management.  
It aims to be care more for privacy and much more friendly to self-hosted infrastructures.

## Status
We are currently putting it all together before official kickoff. See the [Sunrise](https://github.com/thegridprotocol/thegrid/projects/1) project for the current progress.

## Documents
The following bootstrap documents explain what The Grid is in more details, how it came to be, differences with Matrix, how the protocol will be managed by the non-profit and how documentation should take place.
